# GDP_Insights-Unemployment_and_Economic_Trends
In this project, I have analyzed two datasets: one containing unemployment rates and the other containing GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data for various countries. The aim of this analysis is to explore the relationship between a country's economic performance, as measured by GDP, and its unemployment rates. 

## Datasets

### Unemployment Dataset

- Description: This dataset contains unemployment rates over the years, represented in percentages for various countries. The dataset provides insights into the economic health of these countries.

### GDP Dataset

- Description: The GDP dataset includes information on a country's GDP, country code, and country name for the years until 2021. GDP is a key economic indicator that reflects the economic performance and health of a country.

## Data Analysis

To perform the analysis, I carried out the following steps:

1. Merged the two datasets based on the country name.
2. Cleaned the data by dropping rows with non-country entities and filling missing values in the GDP data.
3. Explored and visualized the data to understand the relationship between GDP and unemployment.
4. Conducted statistical tests to verify hypotheses about the data.

## Data Visualization

Created various visualizations, such as line graphs, bar plots, and choropleth maps, to gain insights into the data. Here are a few sample visualizations:

- Line graph showing GDP vs. Unemployment for India and the United States.
- Bar plots of unemployment rates and GDP for specific countries.
- A choropleth map highlighting unemployment rates for different countries in 2021.

## Findings

1. The top five countries with the highest unemployment rates in 2021 include South Africa, Djibouti, Eswatini, Botswana, and Lesotho.
2. A correlation analysis showed a weak negative correlation between unemployment rates and GDP.
3. There is no significant difference in GDP between 2020 and 2021, as indicated by a t-test.

## Conclusion

This analysis suggests that when a country experiences an increase in GDP, there is a tendency for unemployment rates to decrease. However, the relationship is not strongly linear. The findings from this project provide valuable insights into the economic conditions of various countries.

## Dependencies

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scipy

## Findings

1. The top five countries with the highest unemployment rates in 2021 include South Africa, Djibouti, Eswatini, Botswana, and Lesotho.

2. A correlation analysis showed a weak negative correlation between unemployment rates and GDP. This means that as a country's GDP increases, the unemployment rate tends to decrease, but the relationship is not strongly linear.

3. Hypothesis Testing: Conducted a t-test to compare GDP in 2020 and 2021, which revealed that there is no significant difference between the two years.

## Solutions

While this analysis provides valuable insights into the economic conditions of various countries, several potential solutions can be considered:

1. **Economic Policies:** Countries with high unemployment rates might consider implementing economic policies to stimulate economic growth. These policies could include investment in job-creating sectors, labor market reforms, and workforce training programs.

2. **Data Collection and Monitoring:** Policymakers should continuously monitor unemployment and GDP data to assess the impact of economic policies. This data-driven approach will help in making informed decisions and adjusting policies as needed.

3. **International Collaboration:** Sharing best practices and collaborating with other countries can lead to solutions that address global economic challenges. Countries can learn from each other's experiences and successes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis provides insights into the complex relationship between a country's GDP and its unemployment rates. While a higher GDP is generally associated with lower unemployment rates, the relationship is influenced by various factors, including economic policies, global economic conditions, and regional dynamics.

Policymakers, economists, and researchers can use this analysis as a starting point for understanding the economic health of different countries and exploring potential solutions to tackle unemployment challenges. Continuous monitoring and data-driven decision-making are crucial in addressing these economic issues.
